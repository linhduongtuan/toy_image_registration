**Objective**: This repository documents my exploration of image registration techniques for non-standard medical images (outside of CT, PET, MRI). It follows a learn-by-doing approach, showcasing code examples and experiments.

**Experience**: I've experimented with various image registration libraries, including SimpleITK, Scikit-image, and OpenCV.

**Focus**: The primary focus utilizes the imreg_dft library, with demonstrations applied to both toy images and my own dataset.

**Target Audience**: This tutorial aims to assist others working on image registration tasks for non-standard medical images, similar to my own journey.

**Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Contributions are welcome!**
